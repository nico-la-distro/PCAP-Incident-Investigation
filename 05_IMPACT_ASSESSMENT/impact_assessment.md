# Impact Assessment

## Confirmed Findings

| Finding | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Malicious document delivery | HTTP response delivered `Doc3134.doc` from devbyjr.com. |
| Malicious executable delivery | HTTP response delivered `rFrUanXYL.exe` from boloshortolandia.com. |
| Communication with malicious infrastructure | Internal host communicated with multiple domains and IP addresses identified as malicious. |
| Macro-based execution mechanism | `AutoOpen` macro auto-executes and drops `rFrUanXYL.exe` via PowerShell (confirmed by static analysis). |
| File execution | Confirmed in isolated dynamic analysis: `rFrUanXYL.exe` runs, copies itself as `paramvolume.exe`, and deletes the original. |
| Anti-forensic behavior | Self-deletion of the original file after execution. |
| C2 capability | Confirmed via VirusTotal sandbox (same file hash), matching an IP/port already seen in the original capture. |

## Unconfirmed Activity

| Activity | Status |
|---|---|
| C2 communication in this environment | Not observed during dynamic analysis, despite confirmed capability elsewhere. |
| Persistence mechanisms | No persistence key created during dynamic analysis. |
| Data exfiltration | No evidence identified. |
| Lateral movement | No evidence identified. |

## Conclusion

Network and malware analysis confirm the full initial infection chain: 
delivery, macro execution, payload download, and execution. The 
executable did not establish C2 communication in the isolated analysis 
environment, though external sandbox data confirms it is capable of doing 
so. Persistence and further post-compromise activity were not observed.
